# Programming for Data Analysis Project 2: Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset Analysis

Welcome to the Breast Cancer Diagnosis project repository. This project is a part of the Module Programming for Data Analysis in the H. Dip in Computer Programming and Data Analysis course at Atlantic Technological University, Galway.

## Introduction

This project focuses on utilizing data nalisys and machine learning techniques,for diagnosing breast cancer. 

## Project Insights

The analysis of the project presents several analyzes, however it is worth highlighting these promising results in the diagnosis of breast cancer:

- **Model**: Naive Bayes Classifier
- **Accuracy**: 97%

## Analysis Overview

The model's performance was evaluated using the following metrics:

### Confusion Matrix

- True Negatives (TN): 71
- False Positives (FP): 0
- False Negatives (FN): 3
- True Positives (TP): 40

### Classification Report

- **Precision**: Benign (96%), Malignant (100%)
- **Recall**: Benign (100%), Malignant (93%)
- **F1-Score**: Benign (0.98), Malignant (0.96)

### Model Performance

The Naive Bayes Classifier excels in identifying benign cases with high precision and recall. However, while maintaining strong precision for malignant cases, there is a slight trade-off with recall. The model's F1-scores highlight its balanced performance in diagnosing breast cancer cases.

## Contribution

This project is a testament to the importance of data analysis and machine learning techniques in improving the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis. It aligns with the broader effort to improve medical diagnostics and contribute to affordable healthcare.

## Acknowledgments

We acknowledge the insights gained from the paper "Using Machine Learning Algorithms for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction and Diagnosis" (FAMS 2016) and "Breast Cancer Prediction Using Neural Networks and Extra Tree Classifier with Feature Ensemble Learning" (2022). These papers provide context to the progress and challenges in the field of breast cancer prediction.
